# LSTM-Driven Stock Price Forecasting
Welcome to the LSTM-Driven Stock Price Forecasting project repository! In this project, we delve into the realm of machine learning and data analysis to predict stock price returns using the LSTM neural network. Additionally, we create an interactive dashboard for comprehensive stock analysis using the Plotly Dash framework.

## Project Overview
This project encompasses two pivotal aspects:

## Stock Price Prediction using LSTM:
In the initial phase, we harness the power of the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict stock price returns. By training the LSTM model on historical stock data, we aim to capture intricate temporal patterns in the stock market, allowing us to make accurate predictions.

## Interactive Dashboard for Stock Analysis using Plotly Dash:
The subsequent phase involves crafting an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash. This versatile platform seamlessly integrates data from various sources, including the NSE TATA GLOBAL dataset and a multi-stock dataset featuring prominent companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook. Users can explore dynamic visualizations and tools to conduct comprehensive stock analysis.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

1. **code/**: Contains the Python scripts for training the LSTM model and creating the Plotly Dash dashboard.
2. **datasets/**: Includes the datasets essential for this project, including the NSE TATA GLOBAL dataset and the multi-stock dataset.
3. **saved_model.h5**: The trained LSTM model, saved in a format that can be loaded for future predictions.
4. **stock_app.py**: The script that generates the interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash.
5. **README.md**: You are here! This file provides an overview of the project, its components, and instructions to set up and run the code.

# Getting Started
### Clone the Repository:

## Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lstm-driven-stock-price-forecasting.git

## Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the code/ directory and install the required packages using:

## Stock Price Prediction:
Follow the instructions in the code/ directory to train the LSTM model using the NSE TATA GLOBAL dataset. The model is saved as saved_model.h5 for later use.

## Dashboard Creation:
Run the stock_app.py script to launch the interactive dashboard built with Plotly Dash. Access the dashboard in your web browser to perform detailed stock analysis and visualization.
